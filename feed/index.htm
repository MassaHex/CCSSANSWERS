Explanation:<br />
First, we need to add the digits in one’s place. So, we need to add 3 and 9 which are in one’s place. Adding 3 and 9 gives the sum as 12 which can be renamed as 10 + 2. So, 2 will be placed in the one’s digit in the answer and 1 will be carry forwarded to get added with the numbers in ten’s place. So, adding digits in tens place which are 2 and 1 along with the carry forwarded digit 1 will give sum as 4. So, 4 should be written in ten’s place in the answer. Finally, the sum of given two numbers is 42.</p>

First, we need to add the digits in one’s place. So, we need to add 8 and 5 which are in one’s place. Adding 8 and 5 gives the sum as 13 which can be renamed as 10 + 3. So, 3 will be placed in the one’s digit in the answer and 1 will be carry forwarded to get added with the numbers in ten’s place. So, adding digits in tens place which are 1 and 2 along with the carry forwarded digit 1 will give sum as 4. So, 4 should be written in ten’s place in the answer. Finally, the sum of given two numbers is 43.</p>

Explanation:<br />
While doing subtraction, first we should subtract digits in one’s place and should move to the left i.e., to the ten’s place and so on. In one’s place, if we cannot subtract the subtrahend from minuend, then we should rename minuend as tens and ones. As we have 6 at one’s place in minuend, we can rename 16 as 0 tens and 16 ones. Now, subtract 9 from 16 where difference is equal to 7. So, 7 should be written in one’s digit in the answer. Now, moving to the left that is ten’s place, we have 0 tens. So, subtract 0 from 0 which is 0. So, the total difference is equal to 7.</p>

Explanation:<br />
While doing subtraction, first we should subtract digits in one’s place and should move to the left i.e., to the ten’s place and so on. In one’s place, if we cannot subtract the subtrahend from minuend, then we should rename minuend as tens and ones. As we have 2 at one’s place in minuend, we can rename 62 as 5 tens and 12 ones. Now, subtract 9 from 12 where difference is equal to 3. So, 3 should be written in one’s digit in the answer. Now, moving to the left that is ten’s place, we have 5 tens. So, subtract 1 from 5 which is 4. So, the total difference is equal to 43.</p>

Explanation:<br />
While doing subtraction, first we should subtract digits in one’s place and should move to the left i.e., to the ten’s place and so on. In one’s place, if we cannot subtract the subtrahend from minuend, then we should rename minuend as tens and ones. As we have 7 at one’s place in minuend, we can rename 97 as 8 tens and 17 ones. Now, subtract 8 from 17 where difference is equal to 9. So, 9 should be written in one’s digit in the answer. Now, moving to the left that is ten’s place, we have 8 tens. So, subtract 5 from 8 which is 3. So, the total difference is equal to 39.</p>

Explanation:<br />
While doing subtraction, first we should subtract digits in one’s place and should move to the left i.e., to the ten’s place and so on. In one’s place, if we cannot subtract the subtrahend from minuend, then we should rename minuend as tens and ones. As we have 1 at one’s place in minuend, we can rename 81 as 7 tens and 11 ones. Now, subtract 7 from 11 where difference is equal to 4. So, 4 should be written in one’s digit in the answer. Now, moving to the left that is ten’s place, we have 7 tens. So, subtract 2 from 7 which is 5. So, the total difference is equal to 54.</p>

Explanation:<br />
While doing subtraction, first we should subtract digits in one’s place and should move to the left i.e., to the ten’s place and so on. In one’s place, if we cannot subtract the subtrahend from minuend, then we should rename minuend as tens and ones. As we have 4 at one’s place in minuend, we can rename 74 as 6 tens and 14 ones. Now, subtract 9 from 14 where difference is equal to 5. So, 5 should be written in one’s digit in the answer. Now, moving to the left that is ten’s place, we have 6 tens. So, subtract 0 from 6 which is 6. So, the total difference is equal to 65.</p>

Explanation:<br />
While doing subtraction, first we should subtract digits in one’s place and should move to the left i.e., to the ten’s place and so on. In one’s place, if we cannot subtract the subtrahend from minuend, then we should rename minuend as tens and ones. As we have 3 at one’s place in minuend, we can rename 23 as 1 ten and 13 ones. Now, subtract 8 from 13 where difference is equal to 5. So, 5 should be written in one’s digit in the answer. Now, moving to the left that is ten’s place, we have 1 ten. So, subtract 0 from 1 which is 1. So, the total difference is equal to 15.</p>

Explanation:<br />
First, we need to add the digits in one’s place. So, we need to add 3 and 7 which are in one’s place. Adding 3 and 7 gives the sum as 10 which can be renamed as 10 + 0. So, 0 will be placed in the one’s digit in the answer and 1 will be carry forwarded to get added with the numbers in ten’s place. So, adding digits in tens place which are 2 and 4 along with the carry forwarded digit 1 will give sum as 7. So, 7 should be written in ten’s place in the answer. Finally, the sum of given two numbers is 70.</p>

Explanation:<br />
First, we need to add the digits in one’s place. So, we need to add 6 and 5 which are in one’s place. Adding 6 and 5 gives the sum as 11 which can be renamed as 10 + 1. So, 1 will be placed in the one’s digit in the answer and 1 will be carry forwarded to get added with the numbers in ten’s place. So, adding digits in tens place which are 8 and 0 along with the carry forwarded digit 1 will give sum as 9. So, 9 should be written in ten’s place in the answer. Finally, the sum of given two numbers is 91.</p>

<p>Explanation:<br />
While doing subtraction, first we should subtract digits in one’s place and should move to the left i.e., to the ten’s place and so on. In one’s place, if we cannot subtract the subtrahend from minuend, then we should rename minuend as tens and ones. As we have 3 at one’s place in minuend, we can rename 93 as 8 tens and 13 ones. Now, subtract 5 from 13 where difference is equal to 8. So, 8 should be written in one’s digit in the answer. Now, moving to the left that is ten’s place, we have 8 tens. So, subtract 0 from 8 which is 8. So, the total difference is equal to 88.</p>

Explanation:<br />
While doing subtraction, first we should subtract digits in one’s place and should move to the left i.e., to the ten’s place and so on. In one’s place, if we cannot subtract the subtrahend from minuend, then we should rename minuend as tens and ones. As we have 3 at one’s place in minuend, we can rename 63 as 5 tens and 13 ones. Now, subtract 4 from 13 where difference is equal to 9. So, 9 should be written in one’s digit in the answer. Now, moving to the left that is ten’s place, we have 5 tens. So, subtract 1 from 5 which is 4. So, the total difference is equal to 49.</p>

Explanation:<br />
While doing subtraction, first we should subtract digits in one’s place and should move to the left i.e., to the ten’s place and so on. In one’s place, if we cannot subtract the subtrahend from minuend, then we should rename minuend as tens and ones. As we have 6 at one’s place in minuend, we can rename 86 as 7 tens and 16 ones. Now, subtract 9 from 16 where difference is equal to 7. So, 7 should be written in one’s digit in the answer. Now, moving to the left that is ten’s place, we have 7 tens. So, subtract 1 from 7 which is 6. So, the total difference is equal to 67.</p>

Explanation:<br />
While doing subtraction, first we should subtract digits in one’s place and should move to the left i.e., to the ten’s place and so on. In one’s place, if we cannot subtract the subtrahend from minuend, then we should rename minuend as tens and ones. As we have 2 at one’s place in minuend, we can rename 62 as 5 tens and 12 ones. Now, subtract 7 from 12 where difference is equal to 5. So, 5 should be written in one’s digit in the answer. Now, moving to the left that is ten’s place, we have 5 tens. So, subtract 3 from 5 which is 2. So, the total difference is equal to 25.</p>

Explanation:<br />
While doing subtraction, first we should subtract digits in one’s place and should move to the left i.e., to the ten’s place and so on. In one’s place, if we cannot subtract the subtrahend from minuend, then we should rename minuend as tens and ones. As we have 2 at one’s place in minuend, we can rename 82 as 7 tens and 12 ones. Now, subtract 9 from 12 where difference is equal to 3. So, 3 should be written in one’s digit in the answer. Now, moving to the left that is ten’s place, we have 7 tens. So, subtract 1 from 7 which is 6. So, the total difference is equal to 63.</p>

Explanation:<br />
First, we need to add the digits in one’s place. So, we need to add 6, 7 and 3 which are in one’s place. Adding 6, 7 and 3 gives the sum as 16 which can be renamed as 10 + 6. So, 6 will be placed in the one’s digit in the answer 1 will be carry forwarded to get added with the numbers in ten’s place. So, adding digits in tens place which are 1 and 1 along with the carry forwarded digit 1 will give sum as 3. So, 3 should be written in ten’s place in the answer. Finally, the sum of given three numbers is 36.</p>

Explanation:<br />
First, we need to add the digits in one’s place. So, we need to add 6 and 5 which are in one’s place. Adding 6 and 5 gives the sum as 11 which can be renamed as 10 + 1. So, 1 will be placed in the one’s digit in the answer and another 1 will be carry forwarded to get added with the numbers in ten’s place. So, adding digits in tens place which are 1 and 3 along with the carry forwarded digit 1 will give sum as 5. So, 5 should be written in ten’s place in the answer. Finally, the sum of given two numbers is 51.</p>

While doing subtraction, first we should subtract digits in one’s place and should move to the left i.e., to the ten’s place and so on. In one’s place, if we cannot subtract the subtrahend from minuend, then we should rename minuend as tens and ones. As we have 0 at one’s place in minuend, we can rename 30 as 2 tens and 10 ones. Now, subtract 3 from 10 where difference is equal to 7. So, 7 should be written in one’s digit in the answer. Now, moving to the left that is ten’s place, we have 2 tens. So, subtract 1 from 2 which is 1. So, the total difference is equal to 17.</p>

Explanation:<br />
While doing subtraction, first we should subtract digits in one’s place and should move to the left i.e., to the ten’s place and so on. Now, subtract 3 from 6 where difference is equal to 3. So, 3 should be written in one’s digit in the answer. Now, moving to the left that is ten’s place, we have to subtract 4 from 7 which is 3. After subtracting the given two numbers the difference is equal to 33.</p>

Explanation:<br />
While doing subtraction, first we should subtract digits in one’s place and should move to the left i.e., to the ten’s place and so on. In one’s place, if we cannot subtract the subtrahend from minuend, then we should rename minuend as tens and ones. As we have 2 at one’s place in minuend, we can rename 92 as 8 tens and 12 ones. Now, subtract 9 from 12 where difference is equal to 3. So, 3 should be written in one’s digit in the answer. Now, moving to the left that is ten’s place, we have 8 tens. So, subtract 7 from 8 which is 1. So, the total difference is equal to 13.</p>

So, 0 should be written in one’s digit in the answer. Now, moving to the left that is ten’s place, we have to subtract 4 from 8 which is 4. After subtracting the given two numbers the difference is equal to 40.</p>

Explanation:<br />
While doing subtraction, first we should subtract digits in one’s place and should move to the left i.e., to the ten’s place and so on. In one’s place, if we cannot subtract the subtrahend from minuend, then we should rename minuend as tens and ones. As we have 6 at one’s place in minuend, we can rename 86 as 7 tens and 16 ones. Now, subtract 9 from 16 where difference is equal to 7. So, 7 should be written in one’s digit in the answer. Now, moving to the left that is ten’s place, we have 7 tens. So, subtract 3 from 7 which is 4. So, the total difference is equal to 47.</p>

Explanation:<br />
While doing subtraction, first we should subtract digits in one’s place and should move to the left i.e., to the ten’s place and so on. In one’s place, if we cannot subtract the subtrahend from minuend, then we should rename minuend as tens and ones. As we have 1 at one’s place in minuend, we can rename 41 as 3 tens and 11 ones. Now, subtract 2 from 11 where difference is equal to 9. So, 9 should be written in one’s digit in the answer. Now, moving to the left that is ten’s place, we have 3 tens. So, subtract 2 from 3 which is 1. So, the total difference is equal to 19.</p>

Explanation:<br />
First, we need to add the digits in one’s place. So, we need to add 3, 5 and 7 which are in one’s place. Adding 3, 5 and 7 gives the sum as 15 which can be renamed as 10 + 5. So, 5 will be placed in the one’s digit in the answer 1 will be carry forwarded to get added with the numbers in ten’s place. So, adding digits in tens place which are 2, 1 and 1 along with the carry forwarded digit 1 will give sum as 5. So, 5 should be written in ten’s place in the answer. Finally, the sum of given three numbers is 55.</p>

Explanation:<br />
First, we need to add the digits in one’s place. So, we need to add 8, 6 and 4 which are in one’s place. Adding 8, 6 and 4 gives the sum as 18 which can be renamed as 10 + 8. So, 8 will be placed in the one’s digit in the answer 1 will be carry forwarded to get added with the numbers in ten’s place. So, adding digits in tens place which are 1, 1 and 2 along with the carry forwarded digit 1 will give sum as 5. So, 5 should be written in ten’s place in the answer. Finally, the sum of given three numbers is 58.</p>

Explanation:<br />
While doing subtraction, first we should subtract digits in one&#8217;s place and should move to the left i.e., to the ten&#8217;s place and so on. In one&#8217;s place, if we cannot subtract the subtrahend from minuend, then we should rename minuend as tens and ones. As we have 0 at one&#8217;s place in minuend, we can rename 30 as 2 tens and 10 ones. Now, subtract 2 from 10 where difference is equal to 8. So, 8 should be written in one&#8217;s digit in the answer. Now, moving to the left that is ten&#8217;s place, we have 2 tens. So, subtract 2 from 2 which is 0. So, the total difference is equal to 8.</p>

In one&#8217;s place, if we cannot subtract the subtrahend from minuend, then we should rename minuend as tens and ones. As we have 2 at one&#8217;s place in minuend, we can rename 22 as 1 ten and 12 ones. Now, subtract 9 from 12 where difference is equal to 3. So, 3 should be written in one&#8217;s digit in the answer. Now, moving to the left that is ten&#8217;s place, we have 1 ten. So, subtract 1 from 1 which is 0. So, the total difference is equal to 3.</p>

In one&#8217;s place, if we cannot subtract the subtrahend from minuend, then we should rename minuend as tens and ones. As we have 3 at one&#8217;s place in minuend, we can rename 53 as 4 tens and 13 ones. Now, subtract 8 from 13 where difference is equal to 5. So, 5 should be written in one&#8217;s digit in the answer. Now, moving to the left that is ten&#8217;s place, we have 4 tens. So, subtract 2 from 4 which is 2. So, the total difference is equal to 25.</p>

Explanation:<br />
While doing subtraction, first we should subtract digits in one&#8217;s place and should move to the left i.e., to the ten&#8217;s place and so on. In one&#8217;s place, if we cannot subtract the subtrahend from minuend, then we should rename minuend as tens and ones. As we have 1 at one&#8217;s place in minuend, we can rename 41 as 3 tens and 11 ones. Now, subtract 7 from 11 where difference is equal to 4. So, 4 should be written in one&#8217;s digit in the answer. Now, moving to the left that is ten&#8217;s place, we have 3 tens. So, subtract 2 from 3 which is 1. So, the total difference is equal to 14.</p>

In one&#8217;s place, if we cannot subtract the subtrahend from minuend, then we should rename minuend as tens and ones. As we have 2 at one&#8217;s place in minuend, we can rename 92 as 8 tens and 12 ones. Now, subtract 6 from 12 where difference is equal to 6. So, 6 should be written in one&#8217;s digit in the answer. Now, moving to the left that is ten&#8217;s place, we have 8 tens. So, subtract 5 from 8 which is 3. So, the total difference is equal to 36.</p>

Explanation:<br />
While doing subtraction, first we should subtract digits in one&#8217;s place and should move to the left i.e., to the ten&#8217;s place and so on. In one&#8217;s place, if we cannot subtract the subtrahend from minuend, then we should rename minuend as tens and ones. As we have 1 at one&#8217;s place in minuend, we can rename 51 as 4 tens and 11 ones. Now, subtract 7 from 11 where difference is equal to 4. So, 4 should be written in one&#8217;s digit in the answer. Now, moving to the left that is ten&#8217;s place, we have 4 tens. So, subtract 1 from 4 which is 3. So, the total difference is equal to 34.</p>

In one&#8217;s place, if we cannot subtract the subtrahend from minuend, then we should rename minuend as tens and ones. As we have 4 at one&#8217;s place in minuend, we can rename 34 as 2 tens and 14 ones. Now, subtract 5 from 14 where difference is equal to 9. So, 9 should be written in one&#8217;s digit in the answer. Now, moving to the left that is ten&#8217;s place, we have 2 tens. So, subtract 1 from 2 which is 1. So, the total difference is equal to 19.</p>

Explanation:<br />
While doing subtraction, first we should subtract digits in one&#8217;s place and should move to the left i.e., to the ten&#8217;s place and so on. In one&#8217;s place, if we cannot subtract the subtrahend from minuend, then we should rename minuend as tens and ones. As we have 6 at one&#8217;s place in minuend, we can rename 86 as 7 tens and 16 ones. Now, subtract 7 from 16 where difference is equal to 9. So, 9 should be written in one&#8217;s digit in the answer. Now, moving to the left that is ten&#8217;s place, we have 7 tens. So, subtract 2 from 7 which is 5. So, the total difference is equal to 59.</p>

In one&#8217;s place, if we cannot subtract the subtrahend from minuend, then we should rename minuend as tens and ones. As we have 3 at one&#8217;s place in minuend, we can rename 93 as 8 tens and 13 ones. Now, subtract 6 from 13 where difference is equal to 7. So, 7 should be written in one&#8217;s digit in the answer. Now, moving to the left that is ten&#8217;s place, we have 8 tens. So, subtract 2 from 8 which is 6. So, the total difference is equal to 67.</p>

In one&#8217;s place, if we cannot subtract the subtrahend from minuend, then we should rename minuend as tens and ones. As we have 2 at one&#8217;s place in minuend, we can rename 52 as 4 tens and 12 ones. Now, subtract 7 from 12 where difference is equal to 5. So, 5 should be written in one&#8217;s digit in the answer. Now, moving to the left that is ten&#8217;s place, we have 4 tens. So, subtract 1 from 4 which is 3.

So, 7 should be written in one&#8217;s digit in the answer. Now, moving to the left that is ten&#8217;s place, we have 8 tens. So, subtract 4 from 8 which is 4. So, the total difference is equal to 47.</p>

Explanation:<br />
While doing subtraction, first we should subtract digits in one&#8217;s place and should move to the left i.e., to the ten&#8217;s place and so on. In one&#8217;s place, if we cannot subtract the subtrahend from minuend, then we should rename minuend as tens and ones. As we have 6 at one&#8217;s place in minuend, we can rename 86 as 7 tens and 16 ones. Now, subtract 8 from 16 where difference is equal to 8. So, 8 should be written in one&#8217;s digit in the answer. Now, moving to the left that is ten&#8217;s place, we have 7 tens. So, subtract 1 from 7 which is 6. So, the total difference is equal to 68.</p>

In one&#8217;s place, if we cannot subtract the subtrahend from minuend, then we should rename minuend as tens and ones. As we have 2 at one&#8217;s place in minuend, we can rename 72 as 6 tens and 12 ones. Now, subtract 7 from 12 where difference is equal to 5. So, 5 should be written in one&#8217;s digit in the answer. Now, moving to the left that is ten&#8217;s place, we have 6 tens. So, subtract 1 from 6 which is 5. So, the total difference is equal to 55.</p>

In one&#8217;s place, if we cannot subtract the subtrahend from minuend, then we should rename minuend as tens and ones. As we have 3 at one&#8217;s place in minuend, we can rename 63 as 5 tens and 13 ones. Now, subtract 5 from 13 where difference is equal to 8. So, 8 should be written in one&#8217;s digit in the answer. Now, moving to the left that is ten&#8217;s place, we have 5 tens. So, subtract 4 from 5 which is 1. So, the total difference is equal to 18.</p>

In one&#8217;s place, if we cannot subtract the subtrahend from minuend, then we should rename minuend as tens and ones. As we have 2 at one&#8217;s place in minuend, we can rename 52 as 4 tens and 12 ones. Now, subtract 3 from 12 where difference is equal to 9. So, 9 should be written in one&#8217;s digit in the answer. Now, moving to the left that is ten&#8217;s place, we have 4 tens. So, subtract 1 from 4 which is 3. So, the total difference is equal to 39.</p>

Explanation:<br />
First, we need to add the digits in one&#8217;s place. So, we need to add 3 and 8 which are in one&#8217;s place. Adding 3 and 8 gives the sum as 11 which can be renamed as 10 + 1. So, 1 will be placed in the one&#8217;s digit in the answer and another one will be carry forwarded to get added with the numbers in ten&#8217;s place. So, adding digits in tens place which are 2 and 1 along with the carry forwarded digit 1 will give sum as 4. So, 4 should be written in ten&#8217;s place in the answer. Finally, the sum of given two numbers is 41.</p>

First, we need to add the digits in one&#8217;s place. So, we need to add 7 and 6 which are in one&#8217;s place. Adding 7 and 6 gives the sum as 13 which can be renamed as 10 + 3. So, 3 will be placed in the one&#8217;s digit in the answer and 1 will be carry forwarded to get added with the numbers in ten&#8217;s place. So, adding digits in tens place which are 2 and 3 along with the carry forwarded digit 1 will give sum as 6. So, 6 should be written in ten&#8217;s place in the answer. Finally, the sum of given two numbers is 63.</p>

Explanation:<br />
First, we need to add the digits in one&#8217;s place. So, we need to add 7 and 8 which are in one&#8217;s place. Adding 7 and 8 gives the sum as 15 which can be renamed as 10 + 5. So, 5 will be placed in the one&#8217;s digit in the answer and 1 will be carry forwarded to get added with the numbers in ten&#8217;s place. So, adding digits in tens place which are 2 and 1 along with the carry forwarded digit 1 will give sum as 4. So, 4 should be written in ten&#8217;s place in the answer. Finally, the sum of given two numbers is 45.</p>

Explanation:<br />
First, we need to add the digits in one&#8217;s place. So, we need to add 4 and 7 which are in one&#8217;s place. Adding 4 and 7 gives the sum as 11 which can be renamed as 10 + 1. So, 1 will be placed in the one&#8217;s digit in the answer and another one will be carry forwarded to get added with the numbers in ten&#8217;s place. So, adding digits in tens place which are 3 and 2 along with the carry forwarded digit 1 will give sum as 6. So, 6 should be written in ten&#8217;s place in the answer. Finally, the sum of given two numbers is 61.</p>
